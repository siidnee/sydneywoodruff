						<dd>Lemonade, the visual album, was released April 23, 2016 without any promotion. Directly after, the "Formation Tour" successfully began, with fans already knowing the lyrics. The album gives us a small peek into
							Beyonce's life, including infidelity and restoration, as well as empowering women to stand up and have pride in themselves. The message throughout poems and lyrics within encourage independence and confidence in oneself. Several of <header>
								performances of the album also encourage unity and black empowerment.
